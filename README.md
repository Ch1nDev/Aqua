# Aqua Launcher

A desktop Minecraft launcher built with Electron, React, TypeScript, and Vite. Aqua manages game files and Java runtimes, keeps separate installation profiles, launches the game, and surfaces logs and crash reports without leaving the app. It also picks up Minecraft for Windows (Bedrock) from the Microsoft Store, so both editions can be launched from one place.

## Features

- **Dashboard** with the active installation, player profile, live launcher status, recent sessions, and a single Play action.
- **Accounts** for offline profiles and Microsoft sign-in. Microsoft refresh tokens are encrypted with the operating system credential store (Windows DPAPI, macOS Keychain, or the system keyring); if encryption is unavailable, sessions stay in memory only.
- **Installations** that can be created, renamed, duplicated, edited, and deleted. Deleting an installation removes the profile entry but keeps its game directory, worlds, and downloaded files on disk.
- **Version browser** with releases, snapshots, search, and version metadata from Mojang's manifest.
- **Worlds & backups** for every installation, with world icons, game mode, last-played time, folder sizes, one-click ZIP backups, non-destructive restores, and world deletion. Backups live in the launcher data folder, so they survive profile edits.
- **Server list** with saved addresses, live status checks, quick refresh, and one-click joins: Java servers use Server List Ping and Quick Play, while Bedrock servers are queried over RakNet and opened through Minecraft's `minecraft://` deep link. Each saved server remembers its edition.
- **Bedrock Edition (Windows)** support: Aqua finds Minecraft for Windows and Minecraft Preview in the Microsoft Store packages, shows their versions and data folders, launches them, and lists their worlds alongside Java saves.
- **Bedrock version browser** that lists the builds Microsoft has published to the Store (releases, beta, and preview channels, 500+ builds), downloads the one you pick into the launcher's own folder, and registers it with Windows so it can be played alongside your Store copy.
- **Mod loaders** for Fabric, Quilt, Forge, and NeoForge. Fabric and Quilt use their official meta profiles; Forge and NeoForge run their own installers into the launcher's Minecraft root. A loader is selected per installation and its profile version is what gets downloaded and launched.
- **Minecraft installation pipeline** that resolves inheritance, libraries, natives, assets, and logging configuration, with integrity-checked downloads, verification, and repair. Interrupted installs reuse already-verified files.
- **Mod updates** via Modrinth's hash lookup: check all installed content at once, update individual files, or update everything, while preserving disabled files.
- **Launching** with Java detection, Mojang runtime downloads, per-installation memory, JVM and game arguments, custom resolution, and process tracking.
- **Diagnostics** with the launcher log, per-session game logs, crash reports, filtering, search, copy, open-folder, and export actions.
- **Settings** for theme, accent, interface scale (80–130%), Java runtime, memory, game directory, download concurrency and speed limits, window mode, arguments, startup behavior, and logging.
- **Custom block themes** that paint the sidebar, title bar, and window background with Minecraft block textures or plain colours, each with its own opacity and tile size, plus presets and any custom accent colour. Block textures are read from the client jar of an installed version and cached, so the launcher bundles no game art; without an installed version the feature asks for one instead of substituting placeholder textures.
- **First-run setup** that only asks for a player name. Java, memory, folders, and versions use defaults and are configured later from Settings when needed.
- **Roadmap & docs** page carrying this README and a feature-level view of the roadmap, so what Aqua does and what is planned next can be read inside the launcher instead of on GitHub.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)** is the primary supported platform. The architecture is cross-platform, and macOS/Linux packaging targets are included, but those builds are not actively tested.
- **Node.js 22 or newer** and npm for development.
- An internet connection to fetch the Minecraft manifest, game files, assets, and Java runtimes.
- A Microsoft Azure application ID approved for Minecraft services if you want Microsoft sign-in. Offline profiles need no account or API key.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite renderer at http://localhost:5173
npm run electron:dev # Vite + Electron with hot reload
```

Build and run the production renderer:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Accounts

Aqua supports two account types. **Microsoft sign-in is currently hidden in the UI** while the Azure application is pending Mojang approval, so the app ships with offline profiles only.

1. **Offline profile** — enter a username and play singleplayer, LAN worlds, or modded setups. A deterministic UUID is generated locally. Offline profiles cannot join online-mode servers.
2. **Microsoft** — uses the official OAuth authorization-code flow with PKCE and a local loopback callback, plus your own Azure application (client) ID. Microsoft requires third-party launchers to be approved for Minecraft API access by Mojang. If your application is not approved, sign-in fails with an explanatory error.

The backend is intact; only the UI entry points are gated. To bring Microsoft sign-in back once the application is approved, set `MICROSOFT_AUTH_ENABLED = true` in [`src/lib/features.ts`](src/lib/features.ts) — no other changes are needed.

Once enabled: open **Account → Connect Microsoft**, paste the Application (client) ID from the Azure portal, and complete the browser sign-in. The ID is stored in the launcher settings. Tokens never touch `localStorage` or the renderer process.

## Extra content

Open **Extra content** for the selected installation to browse Modrinth content that matches its loader and Minecraft version. Downloads land in the installation's `mods`, `resourcepacks`, or `shaderpacks` folder, required dependencies are installed with them, and installed files are matched back to Modrinth by SHA-1 so they can be enabled, disabled, deleted, or updated.

**Check updates** compares every matched file with its newest compatible Modrinth release. Updates keep disabled files disabled and remove the previous jar after the new one downloads successfully. Modpack profiles are updated by installing a new pack version rather than editing the pack in place.

A vanilla installation shows a prompt to add a loader first. Loader changes can be made any time on the installation itself; the profile then needs a fresh download, while worlds and saves are untouched.

## Bedrock Edition

Minecraft for Windows and Minecraft Preview are detected through their Microsoft Store packages (`Get-AppxPackage`), which also supply the version, the package family name, and the app id used to start the game. Both the current GDK data layout (`%APPDATA%\Minecraft Bedrock\Users\<id>\games\com.mojang`) and the older UWP one (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang`) are probed, newest first, so the launcher finds the folder the game is actually using.

**Installations** splits into Java and Bedrock tabs, the same way **Versions** does. The Bedrock tab lists every edition Windows has registered for this account plus every build downloaded into the launcher's folder, with the counts shown on the tab; a downloaded build that is the installed one is marked **Registered** and cannot be deleted while Windows runs it.

From **Installations → Bedrock Edition** you can launch the edition, open its data folder, or jump to its worlds. The dashboard also lists detected editions for one-click launching. Bedrock keeps its own account and world data, so Java-only controls such as loaders, memory, Java runtimes, and Modrinth content do not apply to it.

### Playing Bedrock from the Play button

The dashboard's Play button launches one target at a time, and Bedrock editions can be that target. **Use for Play** on a Bedrock card in **Installations** — or simply launching Bedrock from its card, the dashboard section, or a Bedrock server — points Play at that edition: the hero then shows the edition's name and version, swaps the badges for **Bedrock Edition**, and its quick action becomes **Data folder** (opening the edition's `com.mojang` folder) instead of the Java game folder. Picking a Java profile again (**Set as selected** in the profile's menu, or launching it) hands Play back to Java.

Bedrock is started by Windows rather than by the launcher, so it has no process, log, or playtime tracking here; each launch is recorded in **Recent activity** with the edition and version it started.

### Other Bedrock versions

**Versions → Bedrock Edition** lists the builds that have been published to the Microsoft Store, so you can play an older or newer one than the copy the Store installed. The version list is community-maintained and holds Microsoft's own package links ([ddf8196/mc-w10-versiondb-auto-update](https://github.com/ddf8196/mc-w10-versiondb-auto-update) for the UWP-era APPX builds, [MinecraftBedrockArchiver/GdkLinks](https://github.com/MinecraftBedrockArchiver/GdkLinks) for the current MSIXVC ones). Aqua merges both, caches them for six hours, and resolves the actual download URL through Microsoft's update service (`fe3.delivery.mp.microsoft.com`) for APPX entries.

Choosing **Download** streams the package into `bedrock/downloads/` and unpacks it into `bedrock/versions/<version>/` — the launcher's own folder, never the Store's install directory. Two package shapes are supported:

- **APPX** (UWP-era builds): unpacked entry by entry, with the Store signature dropped, exactly as the existing version switchers do. **Register build** then runs `Add-AppxPackage -Path … -Register` through one elevated PowerShell prompt, after which Minecraft for Windows can be launched through the same Activation Manager path the launcher already uses. Windows **Developer Mode** is required and Aqua says so when it is off.
- **MSIXVC** (current GDK builds): saved as `package.msixvc` because only the Microsoft Store can install that format; Aqua keeps the link and the file for reference rather than pretending to install it.

Registering is a swap, not a side-by-side install: Windows points the `Microsoft.MinecraftUWP` package at the downloaded folder for your account, so the Microsoft Store copy stops being listed (the launcher reports Minecraft for Windows as not found) until you install it again. The confirmation dialog says so before anything changes. To get the Store copy back, open the Microsoft Store, find Minecraft for Windows under **Library**, and install it; the Store may also overwrite a registered build on its next update, in which case re-register the download to switch back.

Registration runs as the signed-in Windows account, so with **Developer Mode** on it needs no administrator at all — which matters on a standard-user PC, where an elevated prompt would run as a different account and register the build for the wrong profile. Aqua tries that path first and only falls back to the approved administrator prompt when Windows refuses.

Older builds (1.9.x and the 2015-era previews) also declare framework packages that current Windows 11 no longer ships, such as `Microsoft.Services.Store.Engagement`; Windows then refuses to deploy them. The register dialog can **drop just those requirements** from the build's manifest (a `.bak` copy is kept beside it) so the build registers and starts anyway — the affected Store features are the only thing lost. Removing a downloaded build is refused while Windows has it registered, because the registration points at those files.

Each download is roughly 0.9–1.2 GB, plus the same again once unpacked.

When Windows reports no Store edition but the launcher still has builds downloaded, **Installations** lists them with **Register build**, **Open folder**, and **Remove**, so a swapped or deleted registration can be restored without downloading anything again.

### Bedrock add-ons

**Extra content → Bedrock Edition** manages the packs in the selected edition's `com.mojang` folders, split into behavior, resource, and skin packs with each pack's name, version, size, file count, and install time.

Add-ons are files rather than a service, so there are two ways in:

- **Import add-on** accepts a `.mcpack`, `.mcaddon`, or `.mcworld` file. Packs are unpacked into `behavior_packs`, `resource_packs`, or `skin_packs` according to their manifest's module type, with the manifest's own name and `texts/en_US.lang` translations shown in the list; `.mcworld` files are installed as worlds. Remove deletes a pack folder from Minecraft's directory, and the confirmation says that worlds already using it will lose it.
- **Browse add-ons** is a browser built into the page for the sites that share packs (MCPE Addons, ModBay, and more through the address bar). It runs in its own Electron session with no Node access, no preload script, denied permissions, and only http(s) navigation. Downloads of `.mcpack`, `.mcaddon`, and `.mcworld` are intercepted before they reach disk and installed straight into the edition, with a toast naming the packs and the list refreshing itself; a download that cannot be installed is copied to your Downloads folder so it can still be imported by hand.

MCPEDL is the largest of those sites, but it answers embedded browsers with a bot check that never clears, so its shortcut opens in your real browser and its files come back through **Import add-on**. None of these sites offers a public catalogue API (and Modrinth and CurseForge do not carry Bedrock add-ons), which is why this is a browser view rather than a search integration. Bedrock still applies packs per world, in the game under **Settings → Add-Ons**, so an installed pack appears under a world's add-on settings rather than changing every world at once.

## Worlds and backups

**Worlds & backups** reads each world's `level.dat` to show its real name, game mode, difficulty, Minecraft version, last-played time, file count, and size. From there you can open a world folder, delete a world, or create a ZIP backup.

Switch the page to **Bedrock** to list the worlds in the selected Bedrock edition's `minecraftWorlds` folder. Bedrock names come from each world's `levelname.txt` and its thumbnail from `world_icon.jpeg`; those worlds are listed read-only, because Bedrock manages them inside the Store app.

Backups are stored per installation under `backups/` in the launcher data folder. A restore is deliberately non-destructive: it adds the snapshot as `Name (restored)` beside the existing world, so an accidental restore can never replace the world you are still playing. Worlds are backed up on demand; close Minecraft first if you want a fully consistent snapshot.

## Servers

**Servers** stores the addresses you play on and pings each one the way its edition expects. Java servers use the same Server List Ping handshake as the game's multiplayer screen, so cards show the MOTD, online/max players, server version, latency, and the server's icon; joining launches the selected installation with `--quickPlayMultiplayer`. Addresses entered without a port stay port-free for Quick Join, which keeps SRV records working; status pings follow those records too.

Bedrock servers are queried with RakNet's Unconnected Ping over UDP (port 19132 by default), which returns the MOTD, level name, player counts, version, and game mode. Joining opens Minecraft for Windows through `minecraft://connect?serverUrl=…&serverPort=…`, so Bedrock connects on load without a Java profile. Pick the edition when you add a server; it is shown on the card and can only be changed by re-adding the server.

Quick join needs Minecraft 1.20 or newer. On older versions the game opens normally and Aqua tells you to connect from the multiplayer menu. Offline profiles can only join servers with `online-mode=false`; online-mode servers need Microsoft sign-in.

## Artwork

The dashboard background and wordmark are replaceable without code changes. Drop images into [`public/artwork/`](public/artwork/README.md):

- Background: `background.png`, `background.jpg`, `background.jpeg`, or `background.webp`
- Title: `title.png`, `title.webp`, or `title.svg` (transparent background recommended)

The first matching file wins. If none exists, Aqua falls back to its built-in pixel wordmark and voxel scene. See [`public/artwork/README.md`](public/artwork/README.md) for recommended sizes and composition.

The dashboard background itself prefers the version's own update art. Aqua works out which game drop the selected version belongs to — each version's patch note names its drop — then downloads Mojang's wallpaper pack for that drop, keeps the sharpest wide image, and caches it as a 1920 px JPEG under `cache/artwork/` so it keeps working offline. Newer drops ship text-free wallpapers; older ones only ship the promotional key art. Versions released before the published drops (1.19.4 and older) have no art, so they use `background.*` instead.

## Data locations

Aqua stores its data in Electron's per-user application data directory:

| Platform | Directory |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Aqua Launcher` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Aqua Launcher` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Aqua Launcher` |

Inside that folder:

- `launcher.json` — settings, installations, saved servers, and activity history
- `accounts.bin` — encrypted account tokens
- `minecraft/` — shared versions, libraries, and assets
- `instances/` — default per-installation game directories
- `runtime/` — downloaded Mojang Java runtimes
- `logs/launcher.log` and `logs/game/` — launcher and game output
- `backups/<installation>/` — world backup archives and their index
- `bedrock/versions/<version>/` and `bedrock/downloads/` — downloaded Bedrock builds and their temporary packages

Custom game directories are validated against drive roots and protected system locations such as `C:\Windows` and `Program Files`.

## Development

```bash
npm test         # Node test runner: rules, arguments, paths, worlds, servers, Bedrock, settings
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run icons    # regenerate app icons from scripts/generate-icons.mjs
```

## Packaging

```bash
npm run electron:build
```

This builds the renderer and uses `electron-builder` to produce an installer in `release/` (NSIS on Windows, DMG on macOS, AppImage on Linux). Builds are unsigned by default, so Windows SmartScreen may warn until you add a code-signing certificate.

## Known limitations

- Microsoft authentication is disabled in the UI (`src/lib/features.ts`) until the Azure app is approved by Mojang; the offline path is fully functional without it.
- Quick join (`--quickPlayMultiplayer`) requires Minecraft 1.20 or newer. Older versions still launch, with a prompt to connect manually.
- World backups are ZIP archives created on demand; Aqua does not schedule automatic backups.
- Minecraft 1.12.2 and older (and their Forge/Fabric-era mod loaders) run only on Java 8, which the launcher will not substitute with a newer runtime — install it once from **Settings → Java → Official runtimes → Install Java 8** and those profiles pick it up automatically.
- Offline profiles cannot authenticate with online-mode servers.
- Java detection scans common system locations and Aqua's own runtime folder. You can always select a custom `java.exe` in Settings.
- The launcher supports vanilla and version metadata that follows the standard Mojang format; mod loaders are not installed automatically.
- Bedrock support is Windows-only, and only for the Minecraft Store editions. The Store app owns updates, sign-in, and world management, so Aqua detects, launches, and lists it rather than installing or patching it. Bedrock worlds cannot be backed up or deleted from the launcher.
- Bedrock game versions are derived from the Store package version (package `1.21.2301.0` is game `1.21.23.01`), because the package does not carry the display version. The raw package version is shown next to it.
- Downloaded Bedrock builds are unofficial copies of Store packages: they need Developer Mode and an administrator prompt to register, the Store can overwrite them on update, and MSIXVC builds cannot be registered at all. Only register builds you are entitled to play.
- Older Bedrock builds that Microsoft has delisted can still be listed, but their packages are no longer served, so downloading them fails with a clear message.
- Builds that depend on frameworks Windows 11 no longer ships only register once those requirements are dropped from their manifest, and any Store feature backed by that framework stops working.
- The Play target is remembered for the running session only; the launcher starts on the active Java installation again after a restart.
