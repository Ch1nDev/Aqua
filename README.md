A desktop Minecraft launcher built with Electron, React, TypeScript, and Vite. Aqua manages game files and Java runtimes, keeps separate installation profiles, launches the game, and surfaces logs and crash reports without leaving the app. It also picks up Minecraft for Windows (Bedrock) from the Microsoft Store, so both editions can be launched from one place.

## Features

- **Dashboard** with the active installation, player profile, live launcher status, recent sessions, and a single Play action.
- **Accounts** for offline profiles and Microsoft sign-in. Microsoft refresh tokens are encrypted with the operating system credential store (Windows DPAPI, macOS Keychain, or the system keyring); if encryption is unavailable, sessions stay in memory only.
- **Installations** that can be created, renamed, duplicated, edited, and deleted. Deleting an installation removes the profile entry but keeps its game directory, worlds, and downloaded files on disk.
- **Edition-aware version browser** in **New installation**: Minecraft releases and snapshots, Microsoft's published Bedrock builds, and Horizon releases, each searchable and filtered, with the metadata Aqua needs to install it.
- **Worlds & backups** for every installation, with world icons, game mode, last-played time, folder sizes, one-click ZIP backups, non-destructive restores, and world deletion. Backups live in the launcher data folder, so they survive profile edits.
- **Server list** with saved addresses, live status checks, quick refresh, and one-click joins: Java servers use Server List Ping and Quick Play, while Bedrock servers are queried over RakNet and opened through Minecraft's `minecraft://` deep link. Each saved server remembers its edition.
- **Discord Rich Presence** (opt-in): shows the active Java instance, Minecraft version, loader and elapsed time, plus the server address only when a second switch allows it. Discord's Join action opens Aqua's normal confirmation instead of joining silently.
- **Bedrock Edition (Windows)** support: Aqua finds Minecraft for Windows and Minecraft Preview in the Microsoft Store packages, shows their versions and data folders, launches them, and lists their worlds alongside Java saves.
- **Bedrock build browser** that lists the builds Microsoft has published to the Store (releases, beta, and preview channels, 500+ builds), downloads the one you pick into the launcher's own folder, and registers or installs it with Windows so it can be played alongside your Store copy.
- **Horizon (Rust Edition)** support: Aqua installs Horizon's official Rust client itself, provisions the pinned Minecraft and Java files, prepares the game resources with Horizon's bundled preparer, and starts the client directly. No Horizon launcher is involved.
- **Horizon mod browser**: Aqua reads Horizon's registry index directly, the way Horizon's own launcher does, so the mods, native bundles, and resource packs behind playhorizon.dev/mods can be searched and installed without a browser view. Files are size- and SHA-256-checked, installed into Horizon's own folders, and their `horizon-mods.txt` switches are managed from the launcher.
- **Mod loaders** for Fabric, Quilt, Forge, and NeoForge. Fabric and Quilt use their official meta profiles; Forge and NeoForge run their own installers into the launcher's Minecraft root. A loader is selected per installation and its profile version is what gets downloaded and launched.
- **Minecraft installation pipeline** that resolves inheritance, libraries, natives, assets, and logging configuration, with integrity-checked downloads, verification, and repair. Interrupted installs reuse already-verified files.
- **Mod updates** via Modrinth's hash lookup: check all installed content at once, update individual files, or update everything, while preserving disabled files.
- **Launching** with Java detection, Mojang runtime downloads, per-installation memory, JVM and game arguments, custom resolution, and process tracking.
- **Pre-launch checklist** that blocks a missing client jar, a failing install, a 32-bit or incompatible Java runtime, invalid memory, or less than 2 GB free space, and offers the safe fix in the same sheet. Warning-only issues can be dismissed for the session; a healthy profile launches with no extra click.
- **Launch queue** that turns a second Play while an install, launch, or game is in flight into one queued session, advances only after a clean exit, and pauses with a retry action after a crash.
- **Live log tail** that follows a launcher or game log from a byte offset, attributes frames to installed mods, filters by level or mod, and jumps to the first error or warning without reading the whole file again.
- **Verify-all maintenance** that checks every installed profile newest-first in one cancellable pass, repairs missing or damaged game files through the existing installer, keeps one broken profile from stopping the batch, and reports each profile's before/after health and repaired files in Settings → Troubleshooting.
- **Windows file associations and jump list**: double-clicking a `.mrpack`, `.mcpack`, `.mcaddon` or `.mcworld` opens Aqua's confirmation sheet instead of importing silently, and the taskbar jump list offers the five most recent installed profiles plus the last saved server.
- **Portable configuration transfer** in Settings → Transfer: export settings, themes, profile metadata and saved servers as one JSON file, then add them on another PC. Accounts, tokens, worlds, mods and game files are never included; imports only add missing profiles and servers, preserve machine-specific paths and window placement, and save a backup of the current configuration first.
- **Safe factory reset** in Settings → Reset: preview every category and reclaimable size, export first if you want, then type `RESET`. Accounts and encrypted tokens stay signed in, while worlds, mods, backups, exported files and game folders are never touched. Only launcher-owned caches and logs are cleared; a pre-reset config backup and reset marker are written first.
- **Diagnostics** with the launcher log, per-session game logs, crash reports, filtering, search, copy, open-folder, and export actions.
- **Settings** for interface scale (80–130%), reduce motion, the ambient dashboard scene, Java runtime, memory, shared Minecraft settings, game directory, download concurrency and speed limits, storage cleanup, window mode, arguments, startup behavior, Discord presence, and logging.
- **Tasks** page that collects every background job — game downloads, Java runtimes, Horizon installs and native builds, Bedrock packages, storage scans, and launch preparation — with live progress, speed, size, time remaining, cancel, retry, and clear-finished actions.
- **Shared Minecraft settings** that keep `options.txt`, `optionsof.txt`, `optionsshaders.txt`, and `servers.dat` identical across installations, covering video, audio, controls, language, shaders, and the multiplayer server list.
- **Mod retargeting** that rewrites a mod's declared Minecraft version range for the selected profile when the jar is otherwise compatible, keeping the original jar for an undo.
- **First-run setup** that only asks for a player name. Java, memory, folders, and versions use defaults and are configured later from Settings when needed.
- **Roadmap & docs** page carrying this README and a feature-level view of the roadmap, so what Aqua does and what is planned next can be read inside the launcher instead of on GitHub.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)** is the primary supported platform. The architecture is cross-platform, and macOS/Linux packaging targets are included, but those builds are not actively tested.
- **Node.js 22 or newer** and npm for development.
- An internet connection to fetch the Minecraft manifest, game files, assets, and Java runtimes.
- A Microsoft Azure application ID approved for Minecraft services if you want Microsoft sign-in. Offline profiles need no account or API key.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite renderer at http://localhost:5173
npm run electron:dev # Vite + Electron with hot reload
```

Build and run the production renderer:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deep links and CLI

Aqua registers the `aqua://` scheme for launch, join, install and open actions:

```text
aqua://join?server=play.example.net
aqua://join?server=play.example.net:25566&edition=java
aqua://launch?instance=Survival
aqua://install?pack=fabulously-optimized
aqua://open?page=stats
```

The same actions are available from a terminal:

```bash
aqua launch "Survival"
aqua join play.example.net --instance "Survival"
aqua install fabulously-optimized
aqua status --json
```

Links and commands are untrusted input: Aqua asks before launching, joining or installing anything. Add `--yes` in CLI scripts to accept the action. A command sent while Aqua is already running is forwarded to that window instead of starting a second copy. `aqua status --json` reports profile names, versions, loaders, pin state and tags only — never tokens, accounts or file paths.

On Windows the installer also associates `.mrpack`, `.mcpack`, `.mcaddon` and `.mcworld` files. Double-clicking one opens Aqua's confirmation sheet first; a pack is inspected before a new profile is created, and Bedrock packs and worlds are imported only after you confirm. The original file is never moved or changed. Only one existing absolute file is accepted at a time, and Aqua rejects unknown extensions, folders, empty files and oversized archives.

On Windows the protocol and file associations are registered per user. Uninstalling removes the app; if Windows keeps a stale `aqua://` or file-association entry, clear it under **Settings → Apps → Default apps**, or reinstall Aqua to repair it. The taskbar jump list offers the five most recent installed profiles and the last server; those items reuse the same `aqua://` launch and join confirmation flow.

## Discord Rich Presence

Discord presence is **off by default** and never includes account names, UUIDs, file paths, or chat. Enable it under **Settings → Discord presence**; a second switch shares the server address and enables Discord's Join action, which opens Aqua's normal join confirmation.

Presence connects only while a Java game is running, retries quietly when Discord is closed, and clears when the game exits, crashes, or the setting is turned off. Aqua uses Discord's local IPC socket directly, so there is no SDK or extra dependency.

A copy built from source needs its own Discord application: create one at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), then start Aqua with `AQUA_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` set to its Application ID. Without that ID the switches remain inert and Aqua writes a single debug line.

## Accounts

Aqua supports two account types.

1. **Offline profile** — enter a username and play singleplayer, LAN worlds, or modded setups. A deterministic UUID is generated locally. Offline profiles cannot join online-mode servers.
2. **Microsoft** — uses the official OAuth authorization-code flow with PKCE and a local loopback callback. Sign in with the account that owns Minecraft: Java Edition; Aqua loads your player name and skin and stores only an encrypted refresh token with your operating system.

The launcher's own approved Azure application credentials are read by the main process from `private/microsoft.json` (`{"clientId": "…", "clientSecret": "…"}`, the secret being optional) or from the directory named by `AQUA_PRIVATE_DIR`. That file is git-ignored and never reaches the renderer, so **Account → Connect Microsoft** starts the browser sign-in immediately and there is nothing to configure in the UI. Tokens never touch `localStorage` or the renderer process.

## Extra content

Open **Extra content** for the selected installation to browse Modrinth content that matches its loader and Minecraft version. Downloads land in the installation's `mods`, `resourcepacks`, or `shaderpacks` folder, required dependencies are installed with them, and installed files are matched back to Modrinth by SHA-1 so they can be enabled, disabled, deleted, or updated.

**Check updates** compares every matched file with its newest compatible Modrinth release. Updates keep disabled files disabled and remove the previous jar after the new one downloads successfully. Modpack profiles are updated by installing a new pack version rather than editing the pack in place.

The wand action on an installed mod **retargets** it to the profile's Minecraft version. Aqua reads the jar's loader metadata (`fabric.mod.json`, `quilt.mod.json`, `META-INF/mods.toml`, or `META-INF/neoforge.mods.toml`), shows which declared Minecraft ranges it can rewrite, and changes only that declaration; the original jar is kept beside it so the change can be undone. Retargeting does not port code across breaking API changes, so a mod can still fail at runtime after conversion — the dialog says so before it converts anything.

A vanilla installation shows a prompt to add a loader first. Loader changes can be made any time on the installation itself; the profile then needs a fresh download, while worlds and saves are untouched.

## Importing from another launcher

**Installations → Import launcher** scans the standard folders for the vanilla Minecraft launcher, Prism Launcher, MultiMC, CurseForge and ATLauncher, plus any folder you choose. Each profile shows its Minecraft version, loader, mod count, worlds and size, and you can import all of them or only the ones you want.

**Adopt in place** is the default: Aqua points at the existing game folder, so worlds, mods and configs stay where they are and nothing is copied. **Copy into Aqua** creates a separate game folder and copies mods, configs and (optionally) worlds while skipping shared `libraries`, `assets`, `versions`, caches and launcher metadata. Aqua downloads the Minecraft and loader files it needs into its own folder, so neither mode moves or rewrites the source launcher. Duplicate names get a numeric suffix, and a failed profile is removed without touching the source or the profiles already imported.

CurseForge profiles are read from their local `minecraftinstance.json`; the CurseForge API is not used. ATLauncher profiles are read-only.

## Shared Minecraft settings

**Settings → Minecraft settings** keeps one copy of the files Minecraft itself writes for client settings: `options.txt` (video, audio, controls, and language), `optionsof.txt` and `optionsshaders.txt` (modded video and shader selection), and `servers.dat` (the multiplayer list). Mod configs, resource packs, worlds, and saves are never copied.

**Save from <installation>** copies the current files out of that profile, **Apply here** writes them into the selected profile, and **Apply to all** writes them into every Java installation. With **Share settings between installations** on, Aqua also applies the shared copy before each Java launch and captures it again when the game closes, so a change made in game reaches the next profile you start. The files live in `minecraft-settings/` in the launcher data folder, and the panel lists what is stored and when it was last saved.

## Bedrock Edition

Minecraft for Windows and Minecraft Preview are detected through their Microsoft Store packages (`Get-AppxPackage`), which also supply the version, the package family name, and the app id used to start the game. Both the current GDK data layout (`%APPDATA%\Minecraft Bedrock\Users\<id>\games\com.mojang`) and the older UWP one (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang`) are probed, newest first, so the launcher finds the folder the game is actually using.

**Installations** filters by **All**, **Java**, **Bedrock**, and **Horizon**, and **New installation** picks the edition. The Bedrock filter lists every edition Windows has registered for this account plus every build downloaded into the launcher's folder, with the counts shown on the filter; a downloaded build that is the installed one is marked **Registered** and cannot be deleted while Windows runs it.

From **Installations → Bedrock Edition** you can launch the edition, open its data folder, or jump to its worlds. The dashboard also lists detected editions for one-click launching. Bedrock keeps its own account and world data, so Java-only controls such as loaders, memory, Java runtimes, and Modrinth content do not apply to it.

### Playing Bedrock from the Play button

The dashboard's Play button launches one target at a time, and Bedrock editions can be that target. **Use for Play** on a Bedrock card in **Installations** — or simply launching Bedrock from its card, the dashboard section, or a Bedrock server — points Play at that edition: the hero then shows the edition's name and version, swaps the badges for **Bedrock Edition**, and its quick action becomes **Data folder** (opening the edition's `com.mojang` folder) instead of the Java game folder. Picking a Java profile again (**Set as selected** in the profile's menu, or launching it) hands Play back to Java.

Bedrock is started by Windows rather than by the launcher, so it has no process, log, or playtime tracking here; each launch is recorded in **Recent activity** with the edition and version it started.

### Other Bedrock versions

**New installation → Bedrock Edition** lists the builds that have been published to the Microsoft Store, so you can play an older or newer one than the copy the Store installed. The version list is community-maintained and holds Microsoft's own package links ([ddf8196/mc-w10-versiondb-auto-update](https://github.com/ddf8196/mc-w10-versiondb-auto-update) for the UWP-era APPX builds, [MinecraftBedrockArchiver/GdkLinks](https://github.com/MinecraftBedrockArchiver/GdkLinks) for the current MSIXVC ones). Aqua merges both, caches them for six hours, and resolves the actual download URL through Microsoft's update service (`fe3.delivery.mp.microsoft.com`) for APPX entries.

Choosing **Download** streams the package into `bedrock/downloads/` and unpacks it into `bedrock/versions/<version>/` — the launcher's own folder, never the Store's install directory. Two package shapes are supported:

- **APPX** (UWP-era builds): unpacked entry by entry, with the Store signature dropped, exactly as the existing version switchers do. **Register build** then runs `Add-AppxPackage -Path … -Register` through one elevated PowerShell prompt, after which Minecraft for Windows can be launched through the same Activation Manager path the launcher already uses. Windows **Developer Mode** is required and Aqua says so when it is off.
- **MSIXVC** (current GDK builds): an encrypted Store container with no manifest to point at, so it is saved as `package.msixvc` and handed to Windows with **Install build**, which runs `Add-AppxPackage -Path …` unelevated for the signed-in account. Windows deploys it over the copy it is running now, and an older build is passed `-ForceUpdateFromAnyVersion` so the downgrade is accepted. The confirmation spells out that Minecraft's data folder moves when switching between UWP and GDK builds, so worlds should be backed up first.

Registering is a swap, not a side-by-side install: Windows points the `Microsoft.MinecraftUWP` package at the downloaded folder for your account, so the Microsoft Store copy stops being listed (the launcher reports Minecraft for Windows as not found) until you install it again. The confirmation dialog says so before anything changes. To get the Store copy back, open the Microsoft Store, find Minecraft for Windows under **Library**, and install it; the Store may also overwrite a registered build on its next update, in which case re-register the download to switch back.

Registration runs as the signed-in Windows account, so with **Developer Mode** on it needs no administrator at all — which matters on a standard-user PC, where an elevated prompt would run as a different account and register the build for the wrong profile. Aqua tries that path first and only falls back to the approved administrator prompt when Windows refuses.

Older builds (1.9.x and the 2015-era previews) also declare framework packages that current Windows 11 no longer ships, such as `Microsoft.Services.Store.Engagement`; Windows then refuses to deploy them. The register dialog can **drop just those requirements** from the build's manifest (a `.bak` copy is kept beside it) so the build registers and starts anyway — the affected Store features are the only thing lost. Removing a downloaded build is refused while Windows has it registered, because the registration points at those files.

Each download is roughly 0.9–1.2 GB, plus the same again once unpacked.

When Windows reports no Store edition but the launcher still has builds downloaded, **Installations** lists them with **Register build** (APPX) or **Install build** (MSIXVC), **Open folder**, and **Remove**, so a swapped or deleted registration can be restored without downloading anything again. The Bedrock list and the build picker both lead with a **Downloaded builds** strip, so a build that is older than the first page of the catalog still has its action in reach.

### Bedrock add-ons

**Extra content → Bedrock Edition** manages the packs in the selected edition's `com.mojang` folders, split into behavior, resource, and skin packs with each pack's name, version, size, file count, and install time.

Add-ons are files rather than a service, so there are two ways in:

- **Import add-on** accepts a `.mcpack`, `.mcaddon`, or `.mcworld` file. Packs are unpacked into `behavior_packs`, `resource_packs`, or `skin_packs` according to their manifest's module type, with the manifest's own name and `texts/en_US.lang` translations shown in the list; `.mcworld` files are installed as worlds. Remove deletes a pack folder from Minecraft's directory, and the confirmation says that worlds already using it will lose it.
- **Browse add-ons** is a browser built into the page for the sites that share packs (MCPE Addons, ModBay, and more through the address bar). It runs in its own Electron session with no Node access, no preload script, denied permissions, and only http(s) navigation. Downloads of `.mcpack`, `.mcaddon`, and `.mcworld` are intercepted before they reach disk and installed straight into the edition, with a toast naming the packs and the list refreshing itself; a download that cannot be installed is copied to your Downloads folder so it can still be imported by hand.

MCPEDL is the largest of those sites, but it answers embedded browsers with a bot check that never clears, so its shortcut opens in your real browser and its files come back through **Import add-on**. None of these sites offers a public catalogue API (and Modrinth and CurseForge do not carry Bedrock add-ons), which is why this is a browser view rather than a search integration. Bedrock still applies packs per world, in the game under **Settings → Add-Ons**, so an installed pack appears under a world's add-on settings rather than changing every world at once.

## Horizon (Rust Edition)

Horizon is the open-source Rust rewrite of Minecraft: Java Edition (26.3, Wilderness Bound), and it keeps its own game home and worlds. **Installations → Horizon** installs Horizon inside Aqua and starts the Rust client directly — the same external-launch model as Bedrock, not a Java profile. Horizon's launcher is not required, downloaded, or run.

Installing a build from the panel does the whole job inside Aqua's data folder:

- Downloads the matching official game release from `horizon-rust/horizon` on GitHub and verifies its SHA-256 checksum.
- Installs the Minecraft version pinned by the release's `research-lock.json` through Aqua's normal Minecraft pipeline (or reuses an existing Aqua install of it).
- Downloads the pinned server jar and installs the required Mojang Java runtime when Java 25 is not already available.
- Runs Horizon's own bundled `horizon-prepare --prepare` against Aqua's Minecraft folder, then copies the pinned sounds with `horizon-prepare sounds`.
- Writes a build marker and registers the prepared build for direct launch.

The build, downloads, game home, and worlds live under `%APPDATA%\Aqua Launcher\horizon\` on Windows (or the equivalent Aqua `userData` folder on macOS and Linux). Horizon's old launcher folder, `HORIZON_LAUNCHER_HOME`, and `.installed` markers are not read. A build is playable once its resource manifest (`horizon-resources.json`) is present; the panel shows progress for each install and lets you cancel it. If the optional sound copy fails, the build is still installed and the panel notes that it will be silent.

**Play** starts the newest installed build (`horizon-client --resources …`) with the Aqua Horizon game home as its working directory and sets `HORIZON_HOME` for the child. Each build also has its own **Play** button. **Game folder**, **Worlds**, **Builds**, and **Downloads** open Aqua's folders. Because the Rust game runs outside Aqua, Horizon launches have no playtime, log capture, or crash report in Aqua. You still need your own Minecraft: Java Edition copy, which Horizon's preparer reads from the files Aqua installs. [Horizon's site](https://playhorizon.dev/) covers the project.

### Horizon mods

Horizon does not load Fabric or NeoForge jars — it has no Java classes for them to patch. It reads three file types of its own, and Aqua installs each where the Rust client looks for it, under the Horizon game folder beside `options.txt`:

| File | Folder | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.hmod` | `horizon-mods/` | A content mod: blocks, items, recipes, loot and assets, read when the game starts. |
| `.hnmod` | `horizon-native-mods/` | A native mod: a Rust mixin bundle Aqua compiles into the game with Rust. |
| `.zip` | `resourcepacks/` | A resource pack layered over Horizon's resources. |

**Extra content → Horizon Mods → Browse mods** reads the registry behind [playhorizon.dev/mods](https://playhorizon.dev/mods) directly, the way Horizon's own launcher does: search, kind filters, the newest version for Minecraft 26.3, and an **Install** button. The release file's size and SHA-256 are checked, revocations in the registry are respected, and the file lands in the folder above with no separate import step. **Import mod** accepts the same files by hand, and **Open folder** goes to each one.

Horizon keeps switches in `horizon-mods.txt` as `mod.<id>:true` lines. Content mods start off until the Installed list turns them on; native mods run until turned off. Aqua writes that file exactly as the game does and leaves Horizon's key binds alone.

Native `.hnmod` mods are compiled into Horizon by Aqua itself: **Build native game** in the Installed list resolves the Horizon commit the mods pin, downloads that revision's source, applies the mods with `horizon-mixins`, and runs `cargo build --locked` the same way Horizon's launcher does. The finished `native-<revision>-<key>` build is installed beside the release builds and Play starts it like any other. The first build downloads the source (~63 MB) and the crates and can take 20–30 minutes; later builds reuse both.

Rust is downloaded into Aqua on the first build too — a minimal stable toolchain of about 600 MB on disk under `horizon/native/toolchain/`, so rustup does not need to be installed and nothing is added to the system PATH. On Windows Aqua uses the MSVC toolchain when Visual Studio's C++ tools are present and otherwise the GNU toolchain; macOS still needs the Xcode command-line tools for its linker.

## Worlds and backups

**Worlds & backups** reads each world's `level.dat` to show its real name, game mode, difficulty, Minecraft version, last-played time, file count, and size. From there you can open a world folder, delete a world, or create a ZIP backup.

Switch the page to **Bedrock** to list the worlds in the selected Bedrock edition's `minecraftWorlds` folder. Bedrock names come from each world's `levelname.txt` and its thumbnail from `world_icon.jpeg`; those worlds are listed read-only, because Bedrock manages them inside the Store app.

Backups are stored per installation under `backups/` in the launcher data folder. A restore is deliberately non-destructive: it adds the snapshot as `Name (restored)` beside the existing world, so an accidental restore can never replace the world you are still playing. Worlds are backed up on demand; close Minecraft first if you want a fully consistent snapshot.

## Servers

**Servers** stores the addresses you play on and pings each one the way its edition expects. Java servers use the same Server List Ping handshake as the game's multiplayer screen, so cards show the MOTD, online/max players, server version, latency, and the server's icon; joining launches the selected installation with `--quickPlayMultiplayer`. Addresses entered without a port stay port-free for Quick Join, which keeps SRV records working; status pings follow those records too.

Bedrock servers are queried with RakNet's Unconnected Ping over UDP (port 19132 by default), which returns the MOTD, level name, player counts, version, and game mode. Joining opens Minecraft for Windows through `minecraft://connect?serverUrl=…&serverPort=…`, so Bedrock connects on load without a Java profile. Pick the edition when you add a server; it is shown on the card and can only be changed by re-adding the server.

Quick join needs Minecraft 1.20 or newer. On older versions the game opens normally and Aqua tells you to connect from the multiplayer menu. Offline profiles can only join servers with `online-mode=false`; online-mode servers need Microsoft sign-in.

## Artwork

The dashboard background and wordmark are replaceable without code changes. Drop images into [`public/artwork/`](public/artwork/README.md):

- Background: `background.png`, `background.jpg`, `background.jpeg`, or `background.webp`
- Title: `title.png`, `title.webp`, or `title.svg` (transparent background recommended)

The first matching file wins. If none exists, Aqua falls back to its built-in pixel wordmark and voxel scene. See [`public/artwork/README.md`](public/artwork/README.md) for recommended sizes and composition.

The dashboard background itself prefers the version's own update art. Aqua fetches it from `https://aqua.ch1n.dev/api/launcher/artwork/<version>.png`, checks it is a PNG, and caches it under `cache/artwork/` so it keeps working offline. A release with its own artwork keeps it; a release without art walks forward through its own update line to the file named after the update's last release (1.7.6 asks for 1.7.10, 1.20.1 asks for 1.20.2), while 1.5 never borrows 1.6's art. When the endpoint has no art for a version, Aqua falls back to the older Mojang pipeline: it works out which game drop the version belongs to from that version's patch notes, downloads the drop's wallpaper pack, keeps the sharpest wide image, and caches it as a 1920 px JPEG. Versions released before the published drops (1.19.4 and older) have no art, so they use `background.*` instead.

## Data locations

By default, Aqua stores its data in Electron's per-user application data directory:

| Platform | Directory |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Aqua Launcher` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Aqua Launcher` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Aqua Launcher` |

Inside that folder:

- `launcher.json` — settings, installations, saved servers, and activity history
- `accounts.bin` — encrypted account tokens
- `minecraft/` — shared versions, libraries, and assets
- `instances/` — default per-installation game directories
- `runtime/` — downloaded Mojang Java runtimes
- `logs/launcher.log` and `logs/game/` — launcher and game output
- `backups/<installation>/` — world backup archives and their index
- `bedrock/versions/<version>/` and `bedrock/downloads/` — downloaded Bedrock builds and their temporary packages
- `minecraft-settings/` — shared `options*.txt` and `servers.dat`
- `horizon/` — Horizon builds, game home, worlds, downloads, and the native toolchain
- `cache/artwork/` — dashboard version artwork, so it still appears offline

### Portable mode

Pass `--portable` or put an empty `portable.txt` next to `Aqua Launcher.exe` to keep everything beside the executable instead of in AppData. Aqua creates `AquaData/` there and points its data, session data, Electron logs, crash dumps and default downloads at it before the single-instance lock is taken. The About page shows the active data folder and a **Portable** badge.

Portable mode never registers the `aqua://` protocol, file associations or a login-at-startup entry, so Windows gets no registry writes from the launcher. If the folder is read-only, Aqua shows a clear error and starts with the normal AppData location instead of crashing. Updates are manual: replace the folder when a new build is ready. A drive that disappears while Aqua is running can still interrupt a write, but settings and profile saves use same-folder temporary files and atomic renames, so the previous config remains readable on the next launch.

Custom game directories are validated against drive roots and protected system locations such as `C:\Windows` and `Program Files`.

## Accessibility

Aqua is keyboard-operable from the titlebar to every page: use `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` to move, `Enter` or `Space` to activate, and `Escape` to close dialogs, drawers and the command palette. A **Skip to content** link appears on keyboard focus, `Ctrl+K` opens search, and dialogs return focus to the control that opened them. `Ctrl+Enter` launches the current Play target, `Alt+1…9` jump through the sidebar, and `Ctrl+,` opens Settings; press `?` anywhere outside a text field for the full focus-trapped cheat sheet. Page changes and completed background jobs are announced through polite live regions, and toasts use the same pattern.

The launcher also restores its own window position, size and maximized state on the next start, clamped to a visible display so a disconnected monitor cannot leave the window off-screen.

**Settings → Display** adds **High contrast**, **Reduce transparency** and **Reduce motion**. High contrast switches to an opaque black palette with stronger text and borders; reduce transparency removes frosted chrome; reduce motion stops CSS animations and transitions, and Aqua also honours the operating system's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting. Icon-only controls have labels, and primary controls use at least 32×32 px hit targets with visible focus rings.

## Development

```bash
npm test         # Node test runner: rules, paths, worlds, servers, Bedrock, Horizon, docs, settings
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run icons    # regenerate app icons from scripts/generate-icons.mjs
```

## Packaging

```bash
npm run electron:build
```

This builds the renderer and uses `electron-builder` to produce an installer in `release/` (NSIS on Windows, DMG on macOS, AppImage on Linux). Builds are unsigned by default, so Windows SmartScreen may warn until you add a code-signing certificate.

## Known limitations

- Microsoft authentication is disabled in the UI (`src/lib/features.ts`) until the Azure app is approved by Mojang; the offline path is fully functional without it.
- Quick join (`--quickPlayMultiplayer`) requires Minecraft 1.20 or newer. Older versions still launch, with a prompt to connect manually.
- World backups are ZIP archives created on demand; Aqua does not schedule automatic backups.
- Minecraft 1.12.2 and older (and their Forge/Fabric-era mod loaders) run only on Java 8, which the launcher will not substitute with a newer runtime — install it once from **Settings → Java → Official runtimes → Install Java 8** and those profiles pick it up automatically.
- Offline profiles cannot authenticate with online-mode servers.
- Java detection scans common system locations and Aqua's own runtime folder. You can always select a custom `java.exe` in Settings.
- The launcher supports vanilla and version metadata that follows the standard Mojang format; mod loaders are not installed automatically.
- Bedrock support is Windows-only, and only for the Minecraft Store editions. The Store app owns updates, sign-in, and world management, so Aqua detects, launches, and lists it rather than installing or patching it. Bedrock worlds cannot be backed up or deleted from the launcher.
- Horizon is installed and prepared by Aqua; its launcher is not used. Horizon launches still have no playtime or log/crash tracking, and Horizon accounts and extra instances stay outside Aqua. Horizon mods are managed in the game's own `horizon-mods`, `horizon-native-mods`, and `resourcepacks` folders; native `.hnmod` bundles are compiled into a playable Horizon build by Aqua when Rust and a platform linker are installed.
- Bedrock game versions are derived from the Store package version (package `1.21.2301.0` is game `1.21.23.01`), because the package does not carry the display version. The raw package version is shown next to it.
- Downloaded Bedrock builds are unofficial copies of Store packages: APPX builds need Developer Mode (with an administrator prompt as the fallback) to register, MSIXVC builds are installed through Windows and replace the current copy, and the Store can overwrite either on its next update. Only use builds you are entitled to play.
- Older Bedrock builds that Microsoft has delisted can still be listed, but their packages are no longer served, so downloading them fails with a clear message.
- Builds that depend on frameworks Windows 11 no longer ships only register once those requirements are dropped from their manifest, and any Store feature backed by that framework stops working.
- Mod retargeting changes only the declared Minecraft version range. A mod whose code depends on APIs that changed still needs its own updated release.
- The Play target is remembered for the running session only; the launcher starts on the active Java installation again after a restart.
